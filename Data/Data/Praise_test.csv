0,I'd like it better if things were more organized. I have to look in many different parts of the display box to see what is what.,0.0
1,"The patch was fairly simple, but it worked. And he also got rests in the patch. Good song choice. The patch was simple to understand, and very nice and tidy. Only thing I could really suggest is if you wanted to go the extra mile, you couldve added bass notes to it.",3.0
2,"I liked the music patch of the good key, it went well with the symbol sound of the bad key. There was definitely a reward there for the effort to find the good key.",3.0
3,They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.,1.0
4,"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining.",3.0
5,goofy. the sounds used are goofy.,1.0
6,"When I first opened the patch, its overall appearance was nice and clean. The patch was visually appealing with the three keyboards being visible. On a technical note, everything worked smoothly and continued to get better as I plated with the patch more The creator of this patch really took a lot of time and effort to get the song just right. I thought the patch was very advanced and creative. It certainly evoked some dance moves.",3.0
7,"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly.",1.0
8,"I'm still a little unclear about how this patch works. Instead of just one ""Good Key"" there are two different ""Good Keys"" which play two different sound files of trains. The ""Bad Keys"" play the sound of 2 more different trains that alternate back and forth every time you hit a bad key. I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad."" In total there are 5 different sound files present in this patch, which I kind of don't understand. I wasn't able to hear the fifth sound, which apparently was a bell that was also supposed to match with a specific key.",0.0
9,"The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design. It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating. I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining. The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key. They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster.",3.0
10,The patch was cleanly executed technically. They approached the coding assignment similar to the one done in class. The patch was easy to understand and professionally done. I could have added comments to my patch to make the experience less confusing.,2.0
11,"I liked the samples used. Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from. Sounds familiar.",1.0
12,"It is the most difficult experience I ran in to because I could not find key 110 and the author did not tell me which one it was. Granted, if the purpose of the code was to find the key, then the author completed this marvelously. I was also still able to listen to the sounds, and this helped further the appeal.",0.0
13,"I still found it interesting how the user strayed from the basic layout that was shown in class. I enjoyed how they completely eliminated the buttons from the patch, that definitely helped to clean up the patch and make it look more refined.",1.0
14,Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.,1.0
15,"Looks similar to class example but minus the ""numbers"" box to see exactly what number this was, this made it a bit tougher.",0.0
16,"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around. It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it.",0.0
17,"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time. No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it.",0.0
18,Clean looking patch,3.0
19,the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.,1.0
20,only thing i would change would be to get it to work by pressing keyboard buttons,0.0
21,"The patch followed the guidelines perfectly. This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing. However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently.",4.0
22,"They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional. This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way.",0.0
23,"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow.",3.0
24,Pretty simple set up but easy to read and looks tidy. Minimalist and functional.,1.0
25,"The patch works great, and responds to the keys accurately.",4.0
26,The sounds are movie quotes and take longer amount of time to run than the other sound bits. The meter and levelmeter both light up and provide a visual feedback as well as the sound.,1.0
27,"-Your introduction is well-written.
 
 -I would consider changing your ""code verification"" section. You didn't necessarily verify your code, you just ran it. You should verify it by hand or by using Wolfram Alpha.
 
 -Your ""Study and Results"" section was very thorough. I would talk about the tables of values a little more. 
 
 -You wrote this in your Study section, ""When altering the MATLAB code to use my own two non-linear equations, the intersection points change."" Where is your proof of this? I would put a figure of what MATLAB produced and actually define your own two non-linear equations.
 
 
 
 Great job!",3.0
28,"Visually logical and simple, including colored buttons indicating ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" input.",3.0
29,"Coding was very similar to class example, easy to follow, and it had quite an entertaining outcome.",3.0
30,"The yes sound nice, but the no sound is the sound that most macs make when pressing a wrong key so I was confused for a second. That was clever actually. 
 
 The buttons lit up in different colors, that was a good idea.",2.0
31,This patch looked a little to clumped together. I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys. I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.,0.0
32,"The patch felt very fun to use. It was almost like a game to try and find the right key. I liked how the design was simple and there were only two buttons. The sounds were also very funny and goofy. The ""no"" sound was almost like a cartoon and the ""yes"" sounds was a funny song from Shrek so the patch was very entertaining to use over and over again.",3.0
33,"Small boxes in general, somewhat squishy and close but it does not take away from the performance of the patch. Same like the one in class.",0.0
34,"The patch was set up differently than the others, but it was done in such a way that things were more complicated than they needed to be. On the day this assignment was presented to us, we were shown how to condense the patch so only one set of most of the objects were required, which this patch did not display. Because of this and the lack of labeling, I don't think this patch would be very reusable.",0.0
35,It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.,3.0
36,"I think you did a very good job technically working on this. Although the code was confusing to me, after I played around with the sounds for a while it was easier to see how it works. You also did a good job explaining the changes that you made, making it easier to understand. After looking at your code and the changes made on it from what we did in class, I learned a few new ways to connect the keys and make it so there is multiple ""good keys"" and ""bad Keys"".",4.0
37,"After reading over your report, overall I feel that it is well organized and is reader friendly. 
 
 In the introduction section of the report, you give good insight to what Newton's Method is and how it is applied. This is great because you will be able to tie in what you talked about in this section into the conclusion. 
 
 In the theory section, it seems unfinished. You are right that you have to show the derivations of the your equations but you need to elaborate on what all that is. To the reader, I do not know what all that means. You need to state how it relates to Newton's Method.
 
 In the study and results section, this is were you explain how you came across your graphs and what each graph means. In addition, you should show a caption under each graph such as ""Figure 1""...which will make your report more organized. Also, I am not really sure what the ""Warnings"" are on page 3-4. I have not seen this in the other 4 reports I am critiquing. 
 
 In the conclusion section, I feel you can tie in what you stated in the intro and theory. Also, you can incorporate how it is applied to this class and scientifically applied to engineering.
 
 in the appendix, I ran your code and it worked. 
 
 Overall this report looks good, just modify the report as I have stated above.",3.0
38,They approached it as we did in class except they added buttons with different colors for visually informing when a good/bad key is struck. I learned that the colors of the buttons can be changed to give a visual representation of when keys are struck.,1.0
39,I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily. This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel. I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.,4.0
40,"I would say the biggest thing was that you had to open the files yourself as in it was indicated in the patcher which files to open. Also, it was split into two columns so instead of using just one audio player, there were two. However, the other parts were functional and once you opened the files, it worked just like it was supposed to!",1.0
41,Everything is so big!! and idk what the yellow lines on the bottom lead to/ if anything,0.0
42,"It looks simple. It fulfills the assignment. could maybe be a little more compact, but doesnt really need it to be.",1.0
43,"Coding system similar to that of class example, only difference was the sounds, maybe a few different sounds added in to the mix would have helped.",0.0
44,The overall layout looks pleasant to the eye and not too complex.,1.0
45,"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds, and better songs, to make it an overall better experience.",2.0
46,They tried the basic requirement but I couldn't get any sound.,1.0
47,It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.,3.0
48,They used a subpatcher which makes the entire process seem more streamlined to a user who may not have as much experience in Max/MSP,3.0
49,The sounds are goofy and funny. They make you want to do the patch over and over again because the sounds are entertaining to listen to. It leads a very pleasing and funny experience for the user.,3.0
50,"I didn't recognize the song until after reading the description. I like how it works the design looks kind of simple but it really isn't because of all the cords and things, which is a good thing.
 
 it's kind of slow doesn't really make me feel anything but like you said, it works and thats what matters right now",2.0
51,Easy to use and had some cool sounds. Made me want more sounds to play with and a audio sampler to start constructing some beats!,1.0
52,I got it to work as the assignment describes.,1.0
53,They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom. I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine. I would at least organize the different objects.,0.0
54,It looks like the patch that was assigned to us!,0.0
55,"The look of the patch is very visually appealing. It is in a hexagonal shape, there was definitely a conscious focus on design, which is reflected in this patch. Very strong visually components definitely make the user more interested and engaged to interact with the patch. The cable lines connecting the patch to the speaker have a conscious focus on design as well, with the overlapping and defined peaks.",3.0
56,The look of the patch is very organized and easy to understand. Excellent font choice.,4.0
57,I could not get the sound to work with the keyboard. Only by pushing the open buttons on the patch. I am not sure if this is a problem on my end though.,0.0
58,"It felt confusing due to the lack of directions on the sound bar. With that, it lead to the patch being rather complex.",0.0
59,"It was easy to figure out what key to type to find the (96) value. I was somewhat upset that it states it's looking for the ""~"" key (126) when it is actually looking for the ""`"" key (96). This is the only project that actually states what key it's looking for, so it makes it more user friendly compared to the other projects. Thank you. The sounds are simple.",1.0
60,again. very simple.,0.0
61,"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified.",1.0
62,The patch was original in design and easy to use. It is always nice to see alterations in project designs. :),2.0
63,The patch itself gives off a very good feel. It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.,4.0
64,"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really funny music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound, however I think that you might be able to do something more creative.",3.0
65,"I only got one of the sounds to trigger - the ""no."" The Ace Ventura sounds were cool and all, but only if it actually works.",1.0
66,"Very simple, I like it.",2.0
67,"The patch was approached as expected. The only thing that would have been better is if the creator used the message as ""open yes.aif 1""",2.0
68,Really nice. Great use of a sub patcher so that the presentation of the patch is nice and simple.,4.0
69,"The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing. The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed. It looks user friendly and well defined.",3.0
70,Nothing new from what we did in class and they layout could have been a little tidier. May have been cool to add some graphics? A good reminder that we need to push our creativity if we want to come up with something truly original!,0.0
71,"The bad sound was very entertaining. The good sound was very nice at giving positive feedback. However, I feel that the bad sound was a bit too long to get the intended experience.",2.0
72,"Like I said before, it is virtually identical to the example from class. I would suggest cleaning up the patch cords and organization of objects a little more.",0.0
73,The only problem I am noticing is that the creator of the patch didn't use the open message to open the sound from the beginning. That requires the user to set up the patch before they can use it. This seems like a large flaw.,0.0
74,"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining. Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher. The space sounds blew me away.",4.0
75,"There was a really cool and neat idea in the patch that somehow along the way didn't come through. I don't know if something had a wrong path, or something. I did see two message boxes before the speaker, so I don't know if that was the problem or not. The idea was exiting, but sadly I couldn't hear it.",4.0
76,"Aside from the fixing I had to do that I mentioned before, it was good. It meant the basic requirements. The comment wasn't in a comment box, so that may be something to look into. Other than that, keep up the good work.",1.0
77,"I think the sounds used where really unique. I was thoroughly amused by both the Spongbob and Austin Powers soundbites. I seem to enjoy the projects that can make me laugh more than the others, and this one definitely did the trick. The patch was straightforward and easy to use. I found myself searching for the right key even though it was outlined in a comment, just to keep hearing the sounds.",2.0
78,"The presentation is very plain, and looks like they didn't customize it. It is kind of symmetrical, but it looks like they finished it and didn't experiment.",0.0
79,The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.,0.0
80,next time make it normal size i should have to scroll or shrink the page to fit it on my screen,0.0
81,The patch is organized and well put together but there are a few elements that weren't exactly necessary even though they were in the example shown in class.,2.0
82,"The sound was sort of boring at first...but then I found the ""yes"" button and it made me laugh for quite a while, good use of the file.",1.0
83,"The sounds were very professional. The ""yes"" sound was similar to the success sound of a computer or a machine. The ""no"" sound also sounded like a robot machine sound. The experience was very polished and professional.",3.0
84,The patch looks different than the one done in class. It looks almost like a game. I liked the feel of it because it looks very simple without any complicated components or anything.,2.0
85,"For your report, you only partially completed the report. For the Introduction, your information is recited directly from Computing Project 1 Notes. The Introduction needs to have both a problem statement and a description of the study. I do like your theory because you actually showed the derivation of Newton's Method, but you should also explain the theory in words as well because there is more to say. You have some evidence in your Study and Results, but try to explain all the things your code accomplished a bit more. I think including the images showing your results is very useful. Also, you should consider removing the lines of code after your unique nonlinear function, it is very distracting. Once you have completed your report, you need to update your conclusion. I would also like to point out that you should have three codes for this computing project in your appendix; the first is the polynomials given in the CP 1 Notes, second is the code for the two circles, and the third should be your own code with unique nonlinear equations. Don't be afraid to explore the computing project!",0.0
86,"I was not able to get the patch to run. However, the description that was provided makes the patch seem like a very neat idea. I liked that the idea was musical and hope to see something like this that works.",3.0
87,"Aside from the sounds and extra meter, I'd say this patch was pretty run of the mill. I didn't really see a use for the extra meter, but it did add a little extra visual component to the project. One thing I think could be improved is that there was a little extra length of ""noise"" at the end of the yes soundbite and that probably could have been trimmed off.",1.0
88,The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.,3.0
89,I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.,1.0
90,"They did the basic requirement but made it even simpler in appearance, which I dug.",2.0
91,"Not adequate, extra simple patch and concept but it still did not work.",0.0
92,The overall look and feel of the patch is clean and visually pleasing. It has a nice layout and has all the necessary components of a smooth working patch.,3.0
93,The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion. The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to. The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over,1.0
94,"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video.",0.0
95,"I think the coding was approached very well within the constraints of the assignments, meaning there was no other new or different technical components. However, it looks like they really did master the patch that they did complete. The only improvement I could make is to be more aware of the artist element of design within the patch. For example, the cables connecting the components could be connecting in a way to create more of artist representation of the piece.",2.0
96,"At first I thought my computer wasn't working because of the generic sound that Mac's usually make when a key doesn't work, but it was actually the ""no"" key.",0.0
97,"Nothing too surprising here, they did add an additional speaker which was a bonus. Could have added some additional colors or notes to engage the user more. Another example of a good foundation but also a reminder to keep trying to find new ways to express patches in interesting ways.",0.0
98,the song is a little longer than necessary but i like how random it is,2.0
99,"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain.",2.0
100,"At a glance the patch looks good, there is plenty of room and space for it to be seen without confusion and it comes with some handy tips and comments on how to get it to work if you do not find the key it has the answer so it does not frustrate you. The overall look is simple yet amazing.",3.0
101,One of the sounds was funny it made me chuckle but the no sound was a simple no which i would of preferred it to make another sound other than the obvious no or incorrect try again.,1.0
102,"They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked. I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code. I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing.",0.0
103,"Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking. The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel. The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly.",4.0
104,"The patch was well thought out and the audio was entertaining to listen to. The audio files were noises that represented ""Yes"" and ""no"", so they gave a sense of similarity to that of what the instructor presented to the class yet still maintained its originality.",3.0
105,"I think the patch looks really cool. I learned a few new things like the counter. As I went through it, I thought of ways to make it simpler, but Overall, I think it looks really good. Great Job!",4.0
106,The ending section could have been simplified with one speaker output rather than two.,0.0
107,Couldn't get the code to work. I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.,0.0
108,"The user took the time to condense the design to the simplest form I have critiqued so far; very enjoyable to see such an original and simple design. I learned that I could have condensed my own project even further to achieve the same results. The only thing I would like the creator of this patch to do better is to bring more enjoyable audio to future projects. Overall, great job! :)",4.0
109,This patch looks incomplete.,0.0
110,"I enjoyed the good key sound, it was also ironic that the user choose the same good key as I did. On a conceptual note, the program was fun to work with. It was a good mix of goofy and fun.",3.0
111,"The sounds are awesome and unique, this is a very well done patch.",4.0
112,the experience is very simple but it works.,1.0
113,Technically simple. I would have liked an overlap of sound that two speakers would have given the patch. It would have made it more fun to use.,1.0
114,"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch.",3.0
115,"It looks very basic, much like mine.",0.0
116,"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity.",4.0
117,The samples were funny.,0.0
118,"It looks and feels a bit complicated, as if there is too much going on the screen at once.",0.0
119,"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound.",3.0
120,This patch was very similar to mine except a few small differences. The open file location had the exact file location of the sounds which seems more efficient.,0.0
121,The approach was pretty straightforward ad followed the in class instructions.,1.0
122,The patch looks simple and streamlined.,0.0
123,"Nothing about the patch is surprising from a technical perspective, but it works well.",2.0
124,different first sound. I want to enjoy the patch that sound made me mute it pretty quick,0.0
125,"So far this patch is the smallest I've seen. Everything is very condensed which almost makes it look clustered but also gives the patch a sense of unity. It's very clear everything works together and makes the patch seem like a whole thing rather than a bunch of parts working together. This aesthetic is very interesting, I haven't seen it before.",3.0
126,Looks like it could be tighter/organized slightly more.,0.0
127,conceptually it was compartmentalized.,1.0
128,"Nothing here really surprised me, I liked the colors on the buttons. And the sound choice made me think I was not even clicked on Max so yeah that was a good idea.",2.0
129,"I honestly could not get it to play anything. I can open each .wav file in the folder to find out what I'm supposed to hear, but I can't replicate that in the patch. There also wasn't a level meter, so I had no idea if sounds were actually playing or not, or if there was a problem on my end with my speakers. I really wanted to know if I could play 'Sweet Home Alabama'.",0.0
130,"Nicely laid out, and the two buttons, one for 'yes' and the other for 'no', are color coordinated for the user's convenience. Everything is labelled, and even which key is the 'good one' is spelled out as to leave out the guess work.",3.0
131,"The patch is set up in two different max windows and might cause for some confusion, but it not too difficult to follow. The structure is still neat and flows well with good notation to tell the sound files apart.",1.0
132,Couldn't get it to work.,0.0
133,Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first. I was unsure how it worked together. I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.,0.0
134,The overall feel of the patch is very technical and clean. The patch looks similar to the one done in class and has nice layout.,2.0
135,"I think that the sound that you picked for the wrong key is really funny,and the one that you picked for the right key is really amazing, I was so surprised when I heard it, so I'm really enjoy using it.",4.0
136,"It feels somewhat inefficient as in I have to work to make the patch run the way it's supposed to and once I got that going, it was a pretty straightforward yes and no, although the yes was a refreshing 'ding' sound. Overall it was a satisfactory experience with some kinks.",2.0
137,"Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class.",1.0
138,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, the only thing new that I saw was when it was locked everything was hidden. I would really like to learn how you did that. I also think the over all look of the patch was much more clean then the others I saw. The only thing I would work on would be to come up with more ideas to make the game more dynamic.",2.0
139,Not much to look at.,0.0
140,It looks like it is all over the place but once you take a closer look at it its not that bad. There are 3 different pianos and i believe each one has its own little section to perform. I've never heard the song before so i have no idea if it is accurate or not. It was still well done.,3.0
141,"The look of the patch is quite complex, but when you look to where each path goes it starts to make more sense. The visual of three keyboards gives you a nice visual to what is being played, and the labels to each path and keyboard helps a lot. The technical aspect of it is very easy since all you have to do is click on the toggle and the song starts. The small made me smile a bit since it was ""Don't Go Breakin' My Heart"" and it's pretty close to the actual thing. I think what can be done better is having it more clean since tracing each path was a little tough to figure out at times to see what was hooked up to what. Other than that, the concept of the patch was pretty neat and quite clever.",3.0
142,"I thought the user experience was overall very strong with this patch, not only from visual aesthetics, but from the functionality as well. The sounds were entertaining, especially the good key. The sounds were definitely goofy, which make the user interface more fun.",4.0
143,"They approached the assignment similar to the one done in class. They had similar components however, the sounds were different and not recorded but probably taken from somewhere else which was interesting. Also, they added comments to the patch which is something I should have done to make the experience less confusing for users.",2.0
144,"The patch had a very clean and professional look to it. This was because there were only necessary components in the patch, nothing extra. Also, the patch was aligned to the grid and in a straight line so you could tell easily where the lines lead to.",2.0
145,"Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box. Everything worked as it should, and when it should. Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual. As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should.",3.0
146,"The sounds were entertaining to listen to; ""Funk.wav"" was pretty funny to listen to.",1.0
147,The sounds are entertaining. It's a bit confusing that the sound is used for both good key and bad key. At first it made me think I had pressed both keys or there was an error in the way it was coded. I then realized the same sound is used within the good key sound as the bad key sound.

150,"it feels good but the added step of having to turn on the audio manually kind of seems unnecessary than using the computers audio on off. The sounds are good and easy to tell which is good and which is bad. The ""bad"" key sound does keep playing even when the ""good"" key is pressed, not sure if it is suppose to be like that.

152,"While using this patch, I thought that the sounds were really entertaining to listen to. The difference between good key and bad key was very easy to determine and I thought that the sounds were really goofy and made me laugh. The big buttons helped out a lot in giving visual feedback to me and even the subtle changes of buttons changing color helped out a lot. My experience was a fun one, actually.",3.0
153,"Conceptually this piece is very strong and it is designed in a way to really engage the user to feel comfortable interacting with the patch. I did enjoy the sounds, it sounds like these were keys to a guitar and feels very authentic because it is not recognizable. I think the user experience is straight forward and through the tune of the guitar a indication of emotion is felt through the good/bad key.",4.0

156,"This one was actually a lot of fun! I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's. I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine. The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship.",4.0
157,The patch overall worked perfectly and it was amusing and it follows the assignment just right when it comes to requirements and layout.

 b. Program is correct! It runs.
 
 
 
 c. Code is verified. 
 
 
 
 d. Computations have been completed.

 b. Relatively in depth. Could use more insight on Newtonian's Method and how it relates to the code.
 
 
 
 c. Nothing extravagant noticed in New Observations.
 
 
 
 d. Scientific competence is there. No baseless theories or conclusions.

 c. Yes, the conclusion draws directly from the facts. 
 
 
 
 d. Report looks professional in its layout.",3.0
170,"The sounds were nice. The ""bad"" sound did get a little annoying after a while but I've heard worse.

And no, I did not figure it out on my own, I looked it up because I was so annoyed I kept hearing high ho silver awaaaay.

187,Simple and not as developed as it could have been. On a positive note it was not intimidating.,2.0

197,Your code looks like it is running correctly and is getting to the solution. You need to go into more detail of how the code works.

199,I really liked this patch. It was super creative and the sounds were perfect. The good key sound is one that continues on its own for quite some time so its as if it is actually speaking to you and I personally thought it was very funny. This particular patch makes me want to try harder and make more creative and funny sounds.,4.0

201,"It is very simple and very clean. The connectors are compressed and smooth. I like how clean this project is. However, the opening window was very large. I like that there is a comment stating what key opens the yes sound file, making it very easy for me to figure it out, but it states it's looking for the ""~"" key (126) when it is actually looking for the ""`"" key (96). It is interesting that there are two speakers though. Also, because it it compressed, it looked like the the sound meter was connected to the right bottom. It could be pulled down more, so it does not have that overlap.",1.0
