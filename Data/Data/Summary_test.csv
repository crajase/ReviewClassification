,Comments,Summary
0,The patch was cleanly executed technically. They approached the coding assignment similar to the one done in class. The patch was easy to understand and professionally done. I could have added comments to my patch to make the experience less confusing.,0.0
1,"The patch itself is pretty good, the sounds are funny and entertaining. Its a decent patcher but I actually did have to hunt down the specific good key which took a little time but then again that is the point of this assignment so all in all its a delightful patcher. The space sounds blew me away.",2.0
2,Doesn't look like its going to work.,0.0
3,"They also seemed to follow the pattern laid out in class, without adding anything additional. This completed the assignment but did not go overboard in any way.",0.0
4,Very goofy. Dug it.,0.0
5,The patch looks similar to the patch made in class. It feels generic.,2.0
6,I got it to work as the assignment describes.,0.0
7,"It feels similar to the patch I made. Its a clear response when the keys are pushed, with cool sounds.",2.0
8,The patch didn't feature a comment telling me which key was the right key. I was forced to push buttons in an attempt to find the right one and the no sound became annoying. I didn't really enjoy the search because of the no sound.,0.0
9,"I think it works very well. The sounds are cool and offer a kind of variety, so that was nice. The experience was always unique due to the variations in the sounds which made it that much more entertaining.",0.0
10,"This one was actually a lot of fun! I loved how the good key's sound started off the same as the bad key's. I can definitely see someone just pressing the keys one after another and completely missing the sound, which is amusing to imagine. The sounds overall reminded me of the inside of a sci-fi movie spaceship.",2.0
11,"It feel very basic when using the patch. There is no audio feedback, as in meters, when pressing a button; there is no feedback whatsoever when pressing the different buttons on the keyboard. The sounds, though, are pretty goofy so entertainment value is a high point.",2.0
12,"Nothing too surprising here, they did add an additional speaker which was a bonus. Could have added some additional colors or notes to engage the user more. Another example of a good foundation but also a reminder to keep trying to find new ways to express patches in interesting ways.",2.0
13,This patch was very similar to mine except a few small differences. The open file location had the exact file location of the sounds which seems more efficient.,2.0
14,"The bad key is bad indeed, it makes you want to hurry and find the good key. Now the good key is rewarding, I do believe it is from a video game and I cannot recall which but hearing it makes me feel as though i just beat an intense level of some sorts.",4.0
15,"The failure sound is really annoying, I suppose that it makes the user more motivated to find the success sound, but the game requires hearing the fail sound over and over. It would be better if it was a softer, shorter, less annoying sound, or had volume controls so I don't have to endure it.",2.0
16,"This patch is very simple, and it's easy to understand the signal flow.",0.0
17,"Basic concept, kind of monotonous and it took me while to find the 'yes' key! The redeeming factor was the 'yes' sound was crazy and strange and interesting which made it worth the wait.",0.0
18,"The patch was set up differently than the others, but it was done in such a way that things were more complicated than they needed to be. On the day this assignment was presented to us, we were shown how to condense the patch so only one set of most of the objects were required, which this patch did not display. Because of this and the lack of labeling, I don't think this patch would be very reusable.",4.0
19,"The patch is very clean, everything is laid out in straight lines and is extremely easy to understand. There are no unnecessary elements in the patch.",4.0
20,"Technically, it was a simple setup, and nothing too out of the box. Everything worked as it should, and when it should. Nothing exciting, and nothing boring or unusual. As for what could be done better, I got nothing since everything worked and everything was laid out as it should.",2.0
21,The only problem I am noticing is that the creator of the patch didn't use the open message to open the sound from the beginning. That requires the user to set up the patch before they can use it. This seems like a large flaw.,4.0
22,"The patch was well thought out and the audio was entertaining to listen to. The audio files were noises that represented ""Yes"" and ""no"", so they gave a sense of similarity to that of what the instructor presented to the class yet still maintained its originality.",4.0
23,Clean looking patch,0.0
24,"Generally, it was fine. I did have to fix it though. There were spaces in the name of the audio files, and that is a no no, so I removed the spaces, and then it worked. The sounds were cool and kind of reminded me of guitar hero.",0.0
25,"Conceptually this piece is very strong and it is designed in a way to really engage the user to feel comfortable interacting with the patch. I did enjoy the sounds, it sounds like these were keys to a guitar and feels very authentic because it is not recognizable. I think the user experience is straight forward and through the tune of the guitar a indication of emotion is felt through the good/bad key.",2.0
26,"Technically, it wasn't anything complicated, and nothing experimental about it. Because of how simple it was, I didn't learn anything new and nothing jumped out at me. Which is fine since the path to each part was laid out to where it should be. Maybe adding a level meter in just to give the user an idea of how loud everything is, and possibly making sure before using a sound that it's not too loud for the user. Other than that, it was a pretty good patch.",2.0
27,Looks very simple and similar to the patch shown in class. does not have any notes.,0.0
28,"The aesthetic look of the patch is appealing and it has all the components with some of the other patches have been missing. The design of the patch is predominantly on a vertical plane, but here is uniformity and it looks balanced with how the components were placed. It looks user friendly and well defined.",2.0
29,Couldn't get the code to work. I'm not sure if this is a problem on my end.,0.0
30,"I like using this patch, it is fun and entertaining. It made me want to keep searching for the right key until i found it. I also really enjoyed the sounds that you used it really helped with the whole game experience and making it more fun.",2.0
31,"It feels like the 'no' feedback sound is too long and drawn out, yet the 'yes' sound is great and entertaining. It leads to a really annoying experience until I get the right key.",2.0
32,The look of this patch is like a game that I want to play. It is very clean and organized and has more of a sense of design to it then the other patches that I have seen so far.,2.0
33,Didnt like the yelling the other sound was ok. so i didn't try it much,2.0
34,next time make it normal size i should have to scroll or shrink the page to fit it on my screen,2.0
35,"The visual appearance is definitely uniform and appealing conceptually by the simplicity of the design. It definitely allow for a user interface that is not intimidating. I really like the sounds in this patch, they are entertaining. The bad key, had the wah, wah, wah zany sound effect, which is definitely a fitting sound for this key. They good key was great, it reminded me of being in an amusement park riding on a roller coaster.",4.0
36,The patch itself gives off a very good feel. It was not as clear as some of the others and at first it looks like they may have missed a step but they just simplified it to the very core.,2.0
37,The good key is pretty entertaining with the beavis and butthead laugh.,2.0
38,"The patch is very simple, but the creator could have added a few things to make it easier to the user. Firstly, comments that tell the user to turn on the sound, for example, would make is user friendly. Secondly, adding a few features like the ability to pick the ""success"" key would be a great feature for this patch.",0.0
39,"Looks good, everything all lined up. I like it.",0.0
40,"This patched looked a little messier than the others. I noticed there were two different ""ezdac"" objects and two open objects without the file names in them.",2.0
41,It is easy to use though I had to do some guessing to find the good key. I enjoyed the futuristic sounding files and it reminded me of space mountain. It would be well used with some kind of space ship cockpit.,0.0
42,The patch looks very simple. Easy to understand what is intended.,0.0
43,I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute.,0.0
44,The buzzer sound for hitting the wrong key was really loud and annoying to hear over and over again.,2.0
45,"When running the patch, I couldn't get the sounds to play unless I clicked the ""ezdac"" object. This may be a Max thing though, so I wouldn't discredit the creator for it. Prior to critiquing, I had been listening to music, so when the evil laugh played, I actually jumped a little in my seat because it was so loud. I got a laugh out of it, and smiled fondly when I found the right key and recognized the Beavis and Butthead(or what I assumed them to be) laughs. The sounds are goofy with a touch of terror that still has my heart pumping a bit from the surprise. One thing is for sure, I'll be turning my sound down a bit when moving on to the next critique.",4.0
46,The patch is organized and well put together but there are a few elements that weren't exactly necessary even though they were in the example shown in class.,0.0
47,"-Your introduction is well-written.
 
 -I would consider changing your ""code verification"" section. You didn't necessarily verify your code, you just ran it. You should verify it by hand or by using Wolfram Alpha.
 
 -Your ""Study and Results"" section was very thorough. I would talk about the tables of values a little more. 
 
 -You wrote this in your Study section, ""When altering the MATLAB code to use my own two non-linear equations, the intersection points change."" Where is your proof of this? I would put a figure of what MATLAB produced and actually define your own two non-linear equations.
 
 
 
 Great job!",4.0
48,"Very simple, I like it.",0.0
49,"I would have liked more notes and the whole thing just seemed a little crammed together. There's space! Use it! There's also a number box with a -127, and I'm not sure why.",0.0
50,"The patch was clean and simple, once again I noticed the extra toggles. There was no media lines used so it felt kind of plain.",0.0
51,conceptually it was compartmentalized.,0.0
52,"The audio was the most surprising thing, most of the patch looked similar to the class example but it was the audio that made it unique.",2.0
53,It feels very simple to use. It's stated exactly what you have to spell out in order to hear both sounds and activate the good/bad key. I enjoy the sounds.,0.0
54,the patch uses the same formula shown in class but adds more sound and key options.,0.0
55,They approached it exactly as we did in the classroom. I didn't really learn anything from what they did because it's very similar to mine. I would at least organize the different objects.,0.0
56,"This patcher followed all the right rules and components of this assignment. I still suggest spacing out the buttons/keys to look better and cleaner. In this case, I would also advise on stating which key is the good key for the sake of time for this critique assignment. But it still played the sounds and functioned perfectly.",0.0
57,"It is very simple and very clean. The connectors are compressed and smooth. I like how clean this project is. However, the opening window was very large. I like that there is a comment stating what key opens the yes sound file, making it very easy for me to figure it out, but it states it's looking for the ""~"" key (126) when it is actually looking for the ""`"" key (96). It is interesting that there are two speakers though. Also, because it it compressed, it looked like the the sound meter was connected to the right bottom. It could be pulled down more, so it does not have that overlap.",2.0
58,there are several ways to code. this student opted to keep things seperate instead of coding together.,0.0
59,The overall look and feel of the patch is clean and visually pleasing. It has a nice layout and has all the necessary components of a smooth working patch.,2.0
60,"The experience was OK. The sounds were fairly interesting although it was a little confusing. For some reason I though the wrong key was the right key, but that just may be how I took the sound effect.",0.0
61,"The patch was approached as expected. However, the way that they used musical elements was particularly interesting.",0.0
62,"Upon opening this patch was not usable. I had to open/import the sounds myself in order to use the patch. That said, the sound files were labeled in such a way that it was not an issue identifying which went where. The sound files themselves were very clear and pleasant to listen to. The experience sent mixed messages because I wasn't sure if having the sound files opened automatically was a requirement or not.",4.0
63,different first sound. I want to enjoy the patch that sound made me mute it pretty quick,2.0
64,"The patch looks somewhat like a copy of the patcher example, but with some stuff removed and moved around. It is clean, but does not seem to have a particular orginization attached to it.",0.0
65,"The patch looks very good, and is condensed a lot. But still looks like it took some technical abilities to make.",0.0
66,The patch looks simple and streamlined.,2.0
67,Before I ran the patch the overall look and feel was very confusing to me at first. I was unsure how it worked together. I have limited experience with Max and this may be my reason for my confusion but I do think it could be a little more cleaned up.,2.0
68,I could not get your keys to open and play. When I unlocked it to check if they were linked to a file by double clicking on it nothing happened.,0.0
69,"The patch was fairly simple, but it worked. And he also got rests in the patch. Good song choice. The patch was simple to understand, and very nice and tidy. Only thing I could really suggest is if you wanted to go the extra mile, you couldve added bass notes to it.",0.0
70,I think they completed the assignment as asked without adding a lot. The buttons are a nice addition to see which side your typing is going through. It adds a good visual cue in addition to the audio output.,0.0
71,"The ""yes"" key wasn't a letter, but a number key, which I thought was interesting.",2.0
72,"Generally, my first visual impression was that it didn't look as efficient as it could be. Not that I thought it might be dysfunctional but I would say just a little clunky.",2.0
73,"The patch is set up in two different max windows and might cause for some confusion, but it not too difficult to follow. The structure is still neat and flows well with good notation to tell the sound files apart.",2.0
74,Pretty simple set up but easy to read and looks tidy. Minimalist and functional.,0.0
75,"The patch was simple and straight forward with an ease of design. They did add a ""victory"" and ""loser"" aside to a ""yes"" or ""no"" which added to the whole video game music choice. I did do a similar design and structure.",4.0
76,It's pretty basic and straightforward. Lots of notes to let you know what's going on. Simple.,2.0
77,"abrupt. Others took time to make the code elegant, long, or truncated, but you could see the connections. Inputs & outputs. None are seen here.",0.0
78,The patch was neat and organized. But a few of the pieces like the buttons didn't need to be there.,2.0
79,"Kind of confusing. It seems as though Tom tried to create two different Good Key Bad Key patches and put them together to form one. It seems that he experimented and tried to create a more advanced, more complex version of what we made in class.",0.0
80,"The patch is basically what we learned in class, the only thing new that I saw was when it was locked everything was hidden. I would really like to learn how you did that. I also think the over all look of the patch was much more clean then the others I saw. The only thing I would work on would be to come up with more ideas to make the game more dynamic.",2.0
81,This patch looks different from the other ones I've looked at so far. It was definitely interesting. I would assume this person has prior knowledge of Max as this patch appears to be a bit more advanced. It was set up as a project with multiple folders instead of a single patch.,4.0
82,"While using this patch, I thought that the sounds were really entertaining to listen to. The difference between good key and bad key was very easy to determine and I thought that the sounds were really goofy and made me laugh. The big buttons helped out a lot in giving visual feedback to me and even the subtle changes of buttons changing color helped out a lot. My experience was a fun one, actually.",4.0
83,They approached the coding assignment very typically. The patch looks similar to the tutorial done in class. They added the meter for extra flare. I did learn that I should have used more comments in my own patch since it can be very confusing without them.,0.0
84,Everything is so big!! and idk what the yellow lines on the bottom lead to/ if anything,0.0
85,It looks nice and simple. Very small and compact.,0.0
86,"Since it was condensed in size, it definitely took more time to find the right key(S), PLURAL. It was definitely surprising because I literally went down the rows of keys trying to match the numbers. I learned that to be sneaky and troll people, don't show all the connections so that people can get frustrated and slam their keyboard...no I didn't do that..",0.0
87,"I liked the samples used. Trying to remember where the sample for the ""good key"" is from. Sounds familiar.",2.0
88,Simple to look at. Nothing different or unusual about the patch. Basically what we learned in class. There were no comments on the patch to let me know what the good key was.,0.0
89,"The patch was approached as expected. The only thing that would have been better is if the creator used the message as ""open yes.aif 1""",2.0
90,"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job. I understand the allure of creating symmetry with the patch, which is probably why the meter was left out. However, I think they still could have incorporated this in an artistic way to compliment the rest of the piece. I feel this piece was visually and functionally very strong, therefore, I would challenge the creator to link music for the good/bad key that invokes more of an intense emotion. Overall, awesome job!",2.0
91,"They did the basic requirement but made it even simpler in appearance, which I dug.",2.0
92,The ending section could have been simplified with one speaker output rather than two.,0.0
93,"There was some key hunting, and the 'no' sound, which was from Sonic, was a little grating to the ears after a while because of how loud it was being played. The 'yes' sound highly amused me, the victory sound from any given Final Fantasy game. It did feel like a victory after finally finding the 'good' key. It was a nice experience overall.",4.0
94,"Something that I thought that was interesting about the coding on this patch was hiding of almost all the elements, minus the button. I did not know that you can hide all of these elements and is definitely something that I learned while going over this patch. My only concern was that since most of the elements were hidden was that I could not easily click on the ezdac~ message in order to turn the sound on.",0.0
95,"When I first opened the patch, its overall appearance was nice and clean. The patch was visually appealing with the three keyboards being visible. On a technical note, everything worked smoothly and continued to get better as I plated with the patch more The creator of this patch really took a lot of time and effort to get the song just right. I thought the patch was very advanced and creative. It certainly evoked some dance moves.",0.0
96,"This user's patch was laid out differently from the previous patches I looked at. He did not use any buttons and instead of one audio input, had two. The patch was very refined and condensed.",4.0
97,"The patch followed the guidelines perfectly. This patch did not contain each step by step explanation for each button which I have been used to seeing. However, it works perfectly, it is still easy to navigate and I don't think anything could have been done differently.",2.0
98,again. very simple.,0.0
99,It looks like it is all over the place but once you take a closer look at it its not that bad. There are 3 different pianos and i believe each one has its own little section to perform. I've never heard the song before so i have no idea if it is accurate or not. It was still well done.,0.0
100,"I still found it interesting how the user strayed from the basic layout that was shown in class. I enjoyed how they completely eliminated the buttons from the patch, that definitely helped to clean up the patch and make it look more refined.",2.0
101,"The patch was pretty standard in terms of technical setup. It followed the tutorial correctly. As mentioned above, the maniacal laugh was pretty surprising. I cant imagine what people with headphones might have done. The sounds chosen did get a bit annoying after multiple key presses, so using multiple laugh tracks might help with the monotony that tends to occur after multiple attempts. In the future I might suggest labeling your files with your name or some kind of identifier - especially if an instructor is going to be looking at it.",4.0
102,"They seemed to have decided to just stack the codes on top of each other which worked. I think comments would have made for a better experience, so I could test the patch quickly without having to google the right code. I would have added the comment boxes for faster testing.",2.0
103,I think the way they organized the patch was surprising; a lot of people had their patch spread out far apart and made sure the user could separate the different parts easily. This patch sort of bunches everything together giving it a new feel. I don't think there's anything they need to do to improve their assignment.,4.0
104,"The design was enjoyable to the eye, yet it seemed that it could have been simplified if taken the time to do so. I didn't learn anything from the construction besides that fact that there are multiple ways to design the same project (complexity vs simplicity).",0.0
105,It looks fairly organized and well constructed. It feels very straightforward and efficient.,0.0
106,"I learned how to select multiple keys/values using the select object, which was something I was trying to do when creating my patch, and for some reason I just couldn't get it to work. Despite my confusion, I think this person did a pretty good job on the assignment. They achieved something completely unique to what I have seen so far. My one suggestion would be to find clearer and possibly shorter sounds.",2.0
107,"Right off the bat, I noticed that there would be more than two sounds that could possibly be played, and probably some at the same time. No descriptions to how the sounds can be made by each part, but from looking at it one can guess what's going on with it.",0.0
108,They didn't do anything exciting or surprising but they made the patch as simplistic as possible and I almost think that's better than any extra elements. It makes it so the patch is very easy to read and the user can understand everything that's taking place.,2.0
109,"They added some new aspects like sending a message outside of the patcher as to play the sound files. It was surprising but maybe a unnecessary in terms of functionality, but good in learning aspect. The message out was a good thing to see, as well as different.",2.0
110,"I think that the patch that you made is pretty clean, and unique. I didn't see the selective key in that which is an excellence idea to hide it.",2.0
111,"This look is completely different from the rest of the patchers i have seen today and it is very unique and makes me wonder what it will do, it comes with instructions on how to use it and it has a short simple design.",2.0
112,"The patch is a simple variation of the assignment, and looks very clean. It is structure neatly from top to bottom and I know how the patch flows.",2.0
113,"I appreciate the fact that Tom tried to do something different with his project and expand upon what was taught in class, but I do think he could have organized it better and chosen sounds that aren't extremely similar to each other. There is just a lot going on in this patch and I think it should have been simplified.",0.0
114,"Aside from the fixing I had to do that I mentioned before, it was good. It meant the basic requirements. The comment wasn't in a comment box, so that may be something to look into. Other than that, keep up the good work.",0.0
115,Very simplistic of a design! I love it! The clutter from the other designs are essentially non-existent with this design.,2.0
116,"It was a quick experience, but pleasant. The sounds were not obnoxious and nicely leveled. The sounds were traditional positive and negative sounds for guesses, so it wasn't an out of the ordinary experience.",4.0
117,"Like I said before, it was done very simply. Which is always good. The simpler the better. However, I kinda would have liked to see comments of some sort. If I had no idea what was going on, I would be incredibly lost. Honestly, I didn't really learn anything new from this patch.",2.0
118,The patch looks different than the one done in class. It looks almost like a game. I liked the feel of it because it looks very simple without any complicated components or anything.,2.0
119,"The patch was pretty entertaining to work with and would be something fun to use for a kid. Although, when I was working with It I was confused with what keys I was pressing to make the different sounds. The sounds weren't necessarily ""good"" or ""bad"" therefore I think the keys I was pressing should have been more straight forward but they felt random.",0.0
120,"I enjoyed the good key sound, it was also ironic that the user choose the same good key as I did. On a conceptual note, the program was fun to work with. It was a good mix of goofy and fun.",0.0
121,"Visually this patch is extremely sharp looking. The cable line that he used to connect the components look like a piece of art work in itself, with a very mechanical feel. The patch looks very straightforward and user friendly, and followed the guidelines of the assignment exactly.",2.0
122,at first glance the patch looked complicated. however the patch notes were helpful.,0.0
123,"This patch was techinically very visually creative and functionally as well. I did learn to try to stretch myself creatively in terms of trying to program my patch to have an artistic quality as well, and not just merely connect components for functionality purposes, included stretching creativity in sounds waves as well. I do not really have any recommendations for improvements, I think they did a great job.",2.0
124,the experience is very simple but it works.,0.0
125,"This patch is similar to that of the patch we went over in class with it having two branches, one for good key, one for bad key. Both sides have one sfplay~ message, a meter, and a ezdac~. The buttons are a lot bigger and in the center on top, there is a comment that welcomes the user to the patch. In the center of the branches, there is another comment that informs the user what to do.",4.0
126,"The patch had a very clean and professional look to it. This was because there were only necessary components in the patch, nothing extra. Also, the patch was aligned to the grid and in a straight line so you could tell easily where the lines lead to.",2.0
127,"It is very plain. There is nothing but the bare-bones minimum of the essential ""key"" object and the ""ezdac~"" button while everything else is missing. There is an explanatory note making sure the viewer toggles the sound button on. I do not see the links to the specific sound files that should be played depending on the key being pressed.",2.0
128,The look of the patch is virtually the exact same as our example from class last week.,0.0
129,"I wouldn't say this was a simple sequencer. But I would say it was extremely effective in isolating how to achieve different beat qualities; i.e. 1/8, 1/4, & 1/2 notes. This was something I started to mess with, but did not have time to do it for the whole song. so I omitted it and make mine simple full notes. I like that he took time to isolate how to create different beat qualities, something I had trouble with.",0.0
130,the song is a little longer than necessary but i like how random it is,0.0
131,The sounds are simple and not very entertaining in my opinion. The good key is kind of exciting but runs a bit longer than I'd like it to. The experience I get is just wanting to press many different keys over and over,2.0
132,"nothing out of the ordinary, just the basic patch from the video.",0.0
133,"No, while the assignment was very organized and clean, they didn't really do anything exciting. I didn't learn anything from it. They couldve added extra sounds, and better songs, to make it an overall better experience.",2.0
134,"I think you did a good jobs, and also picked a really awesome music. The most impressive thing in your project is a decibel meter to measure the sound.",0.0
135,This is perhaps the most basic incarnation of this particular assignment. The sounds are predictable and obvious in their connotation.,0.0
136,"it feels good but the added step of having to turn on the audio manually kind of seems unnecessary than using the computers audio on off. The sounds are good and easy to tell which is good and which is bad. The ""bad"" key sound does keep playing even when the ""good"" key is pressed, not sure if it is suppose to be like that. I thought I was in the movie Jaws and having a sip of Kool-aid.",4.0
137,"Overall, the design was fairly simple with very few alterations to what the instructor created in class.",2.0
138,They used a subpatcher which makes the entire process seem more streamlined to a user who may not have as much experience in Max/MSP,2.0
139,"Firstly, the sounds are fantastic. The creator expertly utilizes the concept of ""cuteness"". Even though the patch is very simple, the fact that it makes ""human"" sounds gives it an air of humanity.",0.0
140,"The bad sound was very entertaining. The good sound was very nice at giving positive feedback. However, I feel that the bad sound was a bit too long to get the intended experience.",0.0
141,This patch looked a little to clumped together. I think it would look more clear and professional if there was more space in between each of the keys. I also don't see the a button that explains the letter that represents the good key so I'm unsure which key to hit.,2.0
142,Not much to look at.,0.0
143,This patch looks incomplete.,0.0
144,Really nice. Great use of a sub patcher so that the presentation of the patch is nice and simple.,2.0
145,"Very entertaining to use, made me laugh just like the patch did, and it was easy to tell which key was the odd one out.",2.0
146,"I like the simple layout and the description used to navigate the user into understanding the patch and what it does. They approached it the same way we approached it in class whereas one key is good, and the other key is bad. They could have made more good keys.",2.0

 there needs to be an area of new observations ( like if the equations were changed in the code to see what happens to the graphs)

The technical aspect of it is very easy since all you have to do is click on the toggle and the song starts. The small made me smile a bit since it was ""Don't Go Breakin' My Heart"" and it's pretty close to the actual thing. I think what can be done better is having it more clean since tracing each path was a little tough to figure out at times to see what was hooked up to what.

178,I really liked this patch. It was super creative and the sounds were perfect.

 In the introduction section of the report, you give good insight to what Newton's Method is and how it is applied. This is great because you will be able to tie in what you talked about in this section into the conclusion. 
 
 In the theory section, it seems unfinished. You are right that you have to show the derivations of the your equations but you need to elaborate on what all that is. To the reader, I do not know what all that means. You need to state how it relates to Newton's Method.
 
 In the study and results section, this is were you explain how you came across your graphs and what each graph means. In addition, you should show a caption under each graph such as ""Figure 1""...which will make your report more organized. Also, I am not really sure what the ""Warnings"" are on page 3-4. I have not seen this in the other 4 reports I am critiquing. 
 
 In the conclusion section, I feel you can tie in what you stated in the intro and theory. Also, you can incorporate how it is applied to this class and scientifically applied to engineering.

I find this to be rather confusing because all four of the train sounds are very similar to each other and it's hard to comprehend which keys are ""good"" and which keys are ""bad.""
